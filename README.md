## Node.js Working

* **V8 dependency:**  open source JS engine created by google, to execute JS code outside of the browser. V8 translates js stuffs into c++.
* **Libuv Dependency:** C++ open source project gives node access to the OS underlying file system, netorking also handles some kind of concurrency.
* **Purpose of NodeJS:** gives us interface to relate our JS side of our application to the actual c++ thatâ€™s running on our computer interpret and execute our JS code. It also provides a series of wrappers and a very unified inconsistent API for us to use inside our projects.
* **Lib** folder keeps all the Javascript implemntations.
* **Src** folder keeps c++ implementation of all the functions.
* **Process.binding()**  connects JS and C++ functions.

 ## Event loop working
 
* **A Process** is an instance of computer programm that is being executed.
* Within a single process we can have multiple threads.
* **Thread has** some instructions that has to be run by cpu (one by one).
* If we have more than one core inside our cpus we can process multiple threads at a time.
* Whenever you start a node code it automatically creates a thread and then executes the code inside that one thread.
* **Event loop** is like a control structure, decides what a thread should be doing at a given point of time.
* Node event loop is **single threaded** however some of Node framework std lib function that we run outside of event loop are not single thread.

 *Below is the pseudo code to explain the working of Event loop inside node.js*
```javascript
// node myFile.js

const pendingTimers =[];
const pendingOSTasks =[]; // all the things that OS async feature is handling
const pendingOperations = []; // All the things threadpool is hanling

// New timers, tasks, operations are recorded from myFile running
myFile.runContents();

function shouldContinue(){
  // check one: ANy pending setTimeout, setInterval, setIntermediate?
  // check two: Any pending os tasks? (like server listening to port)
  // check three: Any pending long running operation? (like fs module)

  return pendingOSTasks.length || pendingOperations.length || pendingTimers.length
}

// entire body executes in  one 'tick'
while(shouldContinue()){ // event loop
  // 1.) Node looks at pendingTimers and sees if any fucntions are ready to be called.
  // looks at setInterval or setTimeout functions.
  // 2.) Node looks at pendingOSTasks and pendingOperations and calls relevent callbacks.

  // 3.) pause execution. Continue when some no of events occur (like a new pendingOSTasks or pendingOperations are done or a timer is about to complete)

  // 4.) Look at pendingTimers. Call any setIntermediate.

  // 5.) Handle any 'close' event.
}
// exit back to terminal
```

## Thread testing

  ```javascript
  const crypto = require('crypto');
	
	const start = Date.now();
	crypto.pbkdf2('a', 'b', 100000, 512, 'sha512', ()=>{
	  console.log('1:', Date.now()- start);
	});
	
	crypto.pbkdf2('a', 'b', 100000, 512, 'sha512', ()=>{
	  console.log('2:', Date.now()- start);
	});
  ```
	
	Output: 1: 1001, 2: 1012
	  this output should have been 1:1001, 2:2000(approximately) if node was actually single threaded.

* This happens because **libuv c++** side decides to run some computational functions ouside the event loop. They use **ThreadPool**(series of four threads to run comuptational tasks.)
* So **four threads handle** offloading work of expensive calculations outside the event loop.
* But if you use **5 pbkdf2** function ouptut will be like 1: 1750 2:1778 3:1781 4:1784 **5:2661**
* We can write custom JS codes that uses the thread pool.
* All **'fs' module** functions use the threadpool.
* If you see above figure 2 functions are being assigned to a single core that's why it is taking more time to complete task 1,2,3,4 than in **two functions case** as cpu core has to do twice as work. When all these four function get completed 5th function gets added to thread pool. Below image explains the same thing.
* We can change threadpool size using ```process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 2;```

## Node's Asynchronous Feature
* It makes all the requests in same time.
	```javascript
  const https = require('https');
	
	const start = Date.now();
	
	function doRequest(){
	https.request('https://www.google.com', res =>{
	  res.on('data', () =>{});
	  res.on('end', ()=>{
	    console.log(Date.now()-start);
	  })
	})
	.end();
	}
	
	doRequest();
	doRequest();
	doRequest();
	doRequest();
	doRequest();
	doRequest();
  ```
  ```
	OUTPUT : 334 341 342 348 376 382 (NOT USING THREADS).
  ```
 * Instead libUV delegates the request making to the underlying operating system, So it's actually our operating system that does the real HTTP request libUV is used to issue the request and then it just waits on the operating system to emit a signal that some response has come back to.
 * Everything around netorking uses underlying OS, os's async feature
 
 * Node.js is non-blocking I/O, non-blocking means it continues to do other tasks while it is renering ata from some task. One task doesn't block other.
 * Asynchornous programming node.js keep doing other tasks while another task is taking time in fetching some data refer below:
	```javascript
	console.log('Starting');
	
	setTimeout(()=>{
	  console.log('2 sec timer');
	}, 2000)
	
	setTimeout(()=> {
	  console.log('0 sec timer');
	}, 0)
	
	console.log('Stopping');
	
	OUTPUT: 
	Starting
	Stopping
	0 sec timer
	2 sec timer
	`
	
 * **Call Stack** keeps all the running  functions starting from main function in a stack.

 * Why does 0 seconds timer is printing after 'Stopping' log because functions like setTimeout use **Node's API** to proceed when such funtions get added to call stack they move to Node's API where they complete their time/task and move to **Callback queue** inside **Event loop** but we cannot add task from callback queue to Call stack until call stack is empty, And now our Call stack has main function in it, our code will proceed ahead and print 'Stopping' log, the log will be removed and after that the main function will be removed from stack, now stack is empty, So it will start taking functions from Callback Queue.

 ## Multitasking: Putting everything together
 *If we put all the codes together as*
 
 ```javascript
 	const https = require('https');
	const crypto = require('crypto');
	const fs = require('fs');
	const start = Date.now();
	
	function doRequest(){
	https.request('https://www.google.com', res =>{
	  res.on('data', () =>{});
	  res.on('end', ()=>{
	    console.log(Date.now()-start);
	  })
	})
	.end();
	}
	
	function doHash(){
	crypto.pbkdf2('a', 'b', 100000, 512, 'sha512', ()=>{
	  console.log('Hash:', Date.now()- start);
	});
	}
	doRequest();
	
	fs.readFile('multitasks.js', 'utf8', ()=>{
	  console.log('FS:', Date.now()-start);
	});
	
	doHash();
	doHash();
	doHash();
	doHash();
 ```
 ```
OUTPUT: 
340
HASH: 1583
FS: 1585
HASH:1596
HASH:1598
HASH:1609
 ```
 * If we remove all the hash functions from the above code the file reading from hard drive **(fs.readfile)** shows output **FS:28(very fast)** but if we add hash functions then what's happening here?
 * Everything inside **FS module uses Thredpool**. But still how does 5 thread(threadpool has 4 threads only) calls are showing same time, that's beacause when FS fuction goes to thread it make request to Hard drive for file access and then thread frees the FS function until the HD request gets completed and asign that thread to remained HASH function and when one of any hash function gets completed that spot gets asinged to FS function and as we know FS function complete quickly, So that's why **one HASH function got completed before FS**  but if we increase our threadpool size then FS will completed quickly. And if we use 1 then all the hash functions will complete beforeb fs.

 ## Enhancing node performance
 * Two ways to improve node performanc.
	**a.** Use Node in 'Cluster' mode
	**b.** Use worker Threads.
	
 * **Blocking Event loop:** 
	```javascript
	const express = require('express');
	
	const app =express();
	
	function doWork(duration){
	  const start= Date.now();
	  while(Date.now()-start<duration){}
	}
	
	app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
	  doWork(5000);
	  res.send('Hellp, World!');
	});
	
	app.listen(3000);
	```
 * **doWork function** contains a while loop which runs for 5 seconds(does nothing), since event loop is single threaded, so our app will do nothing for 5 seconds(or will take 5 secons to load), It means one single tiny function is blocking our event loop.
	                            Since our event loop is blocked, So,if we try to run our app in two different tabs one after another, later will wait for first request to complete, See the time difference in below image.	
 * Clearly effect of very long running or computational intensive code inside a node project is not ideal at all.
 
 </br>
 
 
 ## Clustering
  * Clustering is used to handle event blocking situation. Below diagrams explain the working of clustering.
  
       <img src="https://github.com/ArpitSachan/Inside-Node.js/blob/master/Screenshot%20(306).png" width=300>          <img src="https://github.com/ArpitSachan/Inside-Node.js/blob/master/Screenshot%20(307).png" width=300> 
  
       ```javascript
	const cluster=require('cluster');
	
	// console.log(cluster.isMaster);
	
	// Is the file being executed in master mode? Checking if we have to go to cluster manger or if we are coming from cluster.fork() (Explained in above figure) and we have to go to Worker instance.
	if(cluster.isMaster){
	  //Cause index.js to be executed again but in child mode
	cluster.fork();
	cluster.fork();
	cluster.fork();
	cluster.fork();
	}else{
	
	  //Im a child I'm going to act like a server and do nopthing
	const express = require('express');
	
	const app =express();
	
	function doWork(duration){
	  const start= Date.now();
	  while(Date.now()-start<duration){}
	}
	
	app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
	  doWork(5000);
	  res.send('Hellp, World!');
	});
	
	app.get('/fast', (req, res)=>{
	  res.send('Hellp, Flash World!');
	});
	app.listen(3000);
	}
      ```
 *  Above we used multiple **cluster.fork()** and created a new route **'/fast'** and if we try to run **'localhost:3000'** and **localhost:3000/fast** simultaneously, we will see that **localhost:3000/fast** runs quickly while localhost:3000 takes 5 seconds(since it has a function call which runs for five seconds). So that's how clustering avoids event loop blocking. And if we use just one **cluster.fork()** then again both routes will take some time to process. 
 
 
 ## The Callback Function
 
 * If we look at function below
 
 ```javascript
 const add =(x, y)=>{
  setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log('Two sec later')
    return (x+y)
  }, 2000)
}


const sum=add(1, 4)
console.log(sum);

 ```
 ```
 OUTPUT: 
 undefined
 Two sec later
 ```
 We see that above function is showing ```undefined``` output in place of sum of two numbers, that's because what has been explained in **Call stack** working section of [Node's Asynchronous Feature](#nodes-asynchronous-feature) but how can we get the get the sum here is using **The Callback Function: A callback is a function called at the completion of a given task; this prevents any blocking, and allows other code to be run in the meantime.** 
 
 ```
 const add =(x, y, callback)=>{
  setTimeout(()=>{
    callback(x+y)
  }, 2000)
}


add(1, 4, (sum) => {
    console.log(sum) // Should print: 5
})

 ```
```
OUTPUT
5
```
* **Callback chaining example:**

```javascript
geocode(location, (error, {latitutde, longitude, location} ={})=>{
  if(error){
    return console.log(error);
  }
  forecast(latitutde, longitude, (error, forecastData) => {
    if(error){
      return console.log(error);

    }
    console.log(location)
    console.log(forecastData)
  })
})
```
